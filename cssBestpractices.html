		<h1>20 CSS Best Practices</h1>


      <ol>
        <li>Create HTML first using a semantic wire frame and meaningful names for ID in class attributes.</li>
        <li>Learn the language of CSS: selector, declaration, and property.</li>
        <li>Learn the CSS syntax: the characters required to write accurate, readable styles.</li>
        <li>Put global styles in the external style sheet. Use embedded and in-line styles only one appropriate.</li>
        <li>Right styles in a sensible order starting with reset code.</li>
        <li>Group styles that apply to similar Contin such as headings, lists, or forms together.</li>
        <li>Put each declaration on it online to make the code easy to read.</li>
        <li>Save your work and refresh your webpage often to observe incremental updates.</li>
        <li>Use comments to separate sections of your style sheet.</li>
        <li>Use comments to document the author, latest update, or anything else that is important.</li>
        <li>Use combination selections such as h1, h2, h3 to code each declaration only once.</li>
        <li>Use combination properties such as margin when appropriate to cut down on the number of declarations.</li>
        <li>Study and truly understand the more difficult concepts of CSS such as flow and blocks versus in-line elements.</li>
        <li>Use an outer wrapper and the margin: 0 auto; declaration to enter content within the outer wrapper.</li>
        <li>Measure the width and % to make the containers responsive.</li>
        <li>Measure tax and ems or % to make the text responsive.</li>
        <li>Use firebug or similar web development tool to analyze and debug errors.</li>
        <li>When debugging, use comments to “common out“ a rule that you are modifying (instead of deleting it).</li>
        <li>Validate all HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>Never stop learning.</li>

      </ol>
