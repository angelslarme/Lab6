		<h1>20 CSS Best Practices</h1>


      <ol>
        <li>1. Create HTML first using a semantic wire frame and meaningful names for ID in class attributes.</li>
        <li>2. Learn the language of CSS: selector, declaration, and property.</li>
        <li>3. Learn the CSS syntax: the characters required to write accurate, readable styles.</li>
        <li>4. Put global styles in the external style sheet. Use embedded and in-line styles only one appropriate.</li>
        <li>5. Right styles in a sensible order starting with reset code.</li>
        <li>6. Group styles that apply to similar Contin such as headings, lists, or forms together.</li>
        <li>7. Put each declaration on it online to make the code easy to read.</li>
        <li>8. Save your work and refresh your webpage often to observe incremental updates.</li>
        <li>9. Use comments to separate sections of your style sheet.</li>
        <li>10. Use comments to document the author, latest update, or anything else that is important.</li>
        <li>11. Use combination selections such as h1, h2, h3 to code each declaration only once.</li>
        <li>12. Use combination properties such as margin when appropriate to cut down on the number of declarations.</li>
        <li>13. Study and truly understand the more difficult concepts of CSS such as flow and blocks versus in-line elements.</li>
        <li>14. Use an outer wrapper and the margin: 0 auto; declaration to enter content within the outer wrapper.</li>
        <li>15. Measure the width and % to make the containers responsive.</li>
        <li>16. Measure tax and ems or % to make the text responsive.</li>
        <li>17. Use firebug or similar web development tool to analyze and debug errors.</li>
        <li>18. When debugging, use comments to “common out“ a rule that you are modifying (instead of deleting it).</li>
        <li>19. Validate all HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>20. Never stop learning.</li>
